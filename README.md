## Household Energy Consumption Forecasting using SARIMA

This project investigates methods for forecasting household energy consumption, with a focus on leveraging the power of the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model. Accurate forecasting of household energy usage is crucial for:

* **Sustainability:**  It allows for informed decisions that reduce energy consumption and environmental impact.
* **Cost-Effectiveness:**  It empowers homeowners to optimize energy usage and minimize costs.
* **Resource Management:**  It aids utility companies in optimizing resource allocation and grid management.

## Project Goals

This project aims to:

* Develop a robust forecasting model for household energy consumption using SARIMA.
* Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
* Demonstrate the potential benefits of SARIMA-based forecasting for stakeholders in the energy sector.

## Literature Review

The literature review explores existing research on household energy consumption forecasting. It highlights the effectiveness of:

* **SARIMA and similar models:**  These models capture seasonal and trend-based patterns in energy consumption data.
* **Hybrid approaches:**  These approaches combine different forecasting techniques for potentially improved accuracy.

The review also emphasizes the importance of performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in assessing forecasting models.

## Proposed System

The proposed system utilizes the SARIMA model to analyze historical household energy consumption data. By identifying patterns and trends within this data, the model can predict future consumption levels. This information can be valuable for:

* **Homeowners:**  Making informed decisions about energy usage and conservation efforts.
* **Utility Companies:**  Optimizing energy generation, distribution, and demand response programs.
* **Policymakers:**  Developing data-driven policies that promote sustainable energy practices.

## Experimental Setup

The project outlines the methodology for training and evaluating the SARIMA model. This includes:

* **Data Acquisition:**  Collecting historical household energy consumption data.
* **Data Pre-processing:**  Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
* **Model Training:**  Fine-tuning the SARIMA model's parameters for optimal performance.
* **Evaluation:**  Assessing the model's accuracy using performance metrics.
